# Intro to Shaders

Slides and code examples for an introductory workshop on fragment shaders originally taught at NYU ITP in Spring 2018.

This repo contains:
  - the slides for the workshop
  - a series of GLSL fragment shaders that introduce GLSL syntax and language features
  - a set of examples that demonstrate how to run a basic shader in Max/MSP/Jitter, openFrameworks, Processing, p5.js, regl.js, and Three.js
